He scored both goals in a 2–1 Boxing Day win against Watford at Vicarage Road, the first of which was his 100th Blues and 150th career club goal. On 9 May, Hazard scored the decisive penalty in a 4–3 shootout win over Eintracht Frankfurt at Stamford Bridge to send Chelsea to the Europa League Final.His tally of 15 assists for the 2018–19 Premier League season saw him win the Premier League's Playmaker of the Season award.

After the match, Hazard suggested that it probably was the last time he had played for the club.

Hazard's pace and dribbling ability made him one of the most exciting players in the Premier League and his vision helped him add 54 assists to the 85 goals he scored in 245 appearances for the Blues.

Last season the two-time Player of the Month award winner helped Chelsea finish third in the Premier League by scoring 16 goals and producing a peerless 15 assists, which earned him the Playmaker of the Season award.
